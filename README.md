# SQL-EDA-Project
Welcome to this project on Sales Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL. We based the project on star schema analysis using two-dimensional tables and one fact table. Different SQL functionalities were used to manipulate data and derive insights that helped in decision-making. 
The project covers different kinds of analysis from creating a database, loading datasets into tables, measures & metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and 2 full-fledged reports.
